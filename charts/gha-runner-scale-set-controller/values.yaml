  ## Defines how the controller should handle upgrades while having running jobs.
  ##
  ## The strategies available are:
  ## - "immediate": (default) The controller will immediately apply the change causing the
  ##   recreation of the listener and ephemeral runner set. This can lead to an
  ##   overprovisioning of runners, if there are pending / running jobs. This should not
  ##   be a problem at a small scale, but it could lead to a significant increase of
  ##   resources if you have a lot of jobs running concurrently.
  ##
  ## - "eventual": The controller will remove the listener and ephemeral runner set
  ##   immediately, but will not recreate them (to apply changes) until all
  ##   pending / running jobs have completed.
  ##   This can lead to a longer time to apply the change but it will ensure
  ##   that you don't have any overprovisioning of runners.
  updateStrategy: "immediate"

  ## Defines a list of prefixes that should not be propagated to internal resources.
  ## This is useful when you have labels that are used for internal purposes and should not be propagated to internal resources.
  ## See https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/issues/3533 for more information.
  ##
  ## By default, all labels are propagated to internal resources
  ## Labels that match prefix specified in the list are excluded from propagation.
  # excludeLabelPropagationPrefixes:
  #   - "argocd.argoproj.io/instance"
