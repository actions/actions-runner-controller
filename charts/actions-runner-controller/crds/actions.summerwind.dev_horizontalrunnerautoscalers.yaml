                    on each webhook requested received by the webhookBasedAutoscaler.


                    This feature requires you to also enable and deploy the webhookBasedAutoscaler onto your cluster.


                    Note that the added runners remain until the next sync period at least,
                    and they may or may not be used by GitHub Actions depending on the timing.
                    They are intended to be used to gain "resource slack" immediately after you
                    receive a webhook from GitHub, so that you can loosely expect MinReplicas runners to be always available.
