# Fix for Empty job_name in Metrics

## Problem
As reported in the issue, the `job_name` label in metrics (`gha_completed_jobs_total`, `gha_started_jobs_total`, `gha_job_startup_duration_seconds`, etc.) started appearing empty around June 9, 2025 (19:00 UTC).

The metrics would show:
```
gha_job_startup_duration_seconds_sum{event_name="",job_name="",job_result="",job_workflow_ref="XXXX",organization="XXXX",repository="XXXX"} 120
```

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be an upstream change in the GitHub Actions Service API. The API was previously sending job information with the field name `jobDisplayName`, but may have changed to use `jobName` instead (or alternates between them).

The ARC code was only looking for `jobDisplayName` in the JSON response:
```go
type JobMessageBase struct {
    ...
    JobDisplayName string `json:"jobDisplayName"`
    ...
}
```

When GitHub's API stopped sending this field or changed the field name, the value became empty.

## Solution
The fix implements a fallback mechanism to handle both possible field names:

### 1. Added Alternative Field Name
Added `JobName` field to `JobMessageBase` struct to capture the alternative field name:
```go
type JobMessageBase struct {
    ...
    JobDisplayName string `json:"jobDisplayName"` // Original field
    JobName        string `json:"jobName"`        // Alternative field
    ...
}
```

### 2. Added GetJobName() Helper Method
Created a method that implements fallback logic:
```go
func (j *JobMessageBase) GetJobName() string {
    if j.JobDisplayName != "" {
        return j.JobDisplayName
    }
    return j.JobName
}
```

This ensures that:
- If `jobDisplayName` is present in the API response, it's used (preferred)
- If `jobDisplayName` is empty but `jobName` is present, `jobName` is used as fallback
- Handles both the old and new API response formats

### 3. Updated All Usage Sites
Updated all code that accesses the job name to use the new method:

**Metrics (`cmd/ghalistener/metrics/metrics.go`):**
```go
labelKeyJobName: jobBase.GetJobName(),
```

**Worker (`cmd/ghalistener/worker/worker.go`):**
```go
jobName := jobInfo.GetJobName()
// ... use jobName for logging and storing in EphemeralRunner status
```

**Listener Logging (`cmd/ghalistener/listener/listener.go`):**
Enhanced logging to show both field values for debugging:
```go
l.logger.Info("Job started message received.", 
    "JobID", jobStarted.JobID, 
    "JobDisplayName", jobStarted.JobDisplayName,
    "JobName", jobStarted.JobName,
    "EffectiveJobName", jobStarted.GetJobName(),
    ...)
```

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- Added new unit tests for `GetJobName()` method covering all scenarios
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Benefits
1. **Backward Compatible**: Continues to work with old API responses using `jobDisplayName`
2. **Forward Compatible**: Works with new API responses using `jobName`
3. **Resilient**: Handles cases where either field might be present
4. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging shows both field values to help diagnose API behavior

## Files Modified
- `github/actions/types.go` - Added JobName field and GetJobName() method
- `github/actions/types_test.go` - Added tests for GetJobName()
- `cmd/ghalistener/metrics/metrics.go` - Updated to use GetJobName()
- `cmd/ghalistener/worker/worker.go` - Updated to use GetJobName()
- `cmd/ghalistener/listener/listener.go` - Enhanced logging to show both fields

## Deployment Notes
After deploying this fix, monitor the controller logs for the new fields:
- `JobDisplayName` - Shows the value of the original field
- `JobName` - Shows the value of the alternative field
- `EffectiveJobName` - Shows which value is actually being used

This will help confirm which field GitHub is currently sending and validate the fix is working correctly.
