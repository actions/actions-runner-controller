`hookdeliveryforwarder` is currently in a Proof-of-Concept phase, not complete, and not supported.
That being said, we are likely accept bug reports with concrete reproduction steps, but usage/support issues.

To use this, you need to write some Kubernetes manifest and a container image for deployment.

For other information, please see the original pull request that introduced it.
