		// Presuming the HRA.spec.scaleTriggers[].duration as "the duration until the reservation expires after a corresponding runner was deployed",
		// it's correct.
		//
		// In other words, we settle on a capacity reservation's ExpirationTime only after the corresponding runner is "about to be" deployed.
		// It's "about to be deployed" not "deployed" because we have no way to correlate a capacity reservation and the runner;
		// the best we can do here is to simulate the desired behavior by reading MaxReplicas and assuming it will be equal to the number of active runners soon.
		//
		// Perhaps we could use RunnerDeployment.Status.Replicas or RunnerSet.Status.Replicas instead of the MaxReplicas as a better source of "the number of active runners".

			//   i=0   - already included in the current desired replicas, but may be about to be deleted
			//   i=1-2 - already included in the current desired replicas
			//   i=3   - not yet included in the current desired replicas, might have been expired while waiting in the queue
			//
			// i=3 is especially important here- If we didn't reset the expiration time of this reservation,
			// it might expire before it is assigned to a runner, due to the delay between the time the
			// expiration timer starts and the time a runner becomes available.
			//
			// Why is there such delay? Because ARC implements the scale duration and expiration as such.
			// The expiration timer starts when the reservation is created, while the runner is created only after
			// the corresponding reservation fits within maxReplicas.
			//
			// We address that, by resetting the expiration time for fourth(i=3 in the above example)
			// and subsequent reservations whenever a batch is run (which is when expired reservations get deleted).

			// There is no guarantee that all the reservations have the same duration, and even if there were,
			// at this point we have lost the reference to the duration that was intended.
			// However, we can compute the intended duration from the existing interval.
