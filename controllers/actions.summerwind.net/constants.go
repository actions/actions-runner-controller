	// This is used to prevent ARC from recreating completed runner pods that are deleted soon without being used at all.
	// In other words, this is used as a timer to wait for the completed runner to emit the next `workflow_job` webhook event to decrease the desired replicas.
	// So if we set 30 seconds for this, you are basically saying that you would assume GitHub and your installation of ARC to
	// emit and propagate a workflow_job completion event down to the RunnerSet or RunnerReplicaSet, vha ARC's github webhook server and HRA, in approximately 30 seconds.
	// In case it actually took more than DefaultRunnerPodRecreationDelayAfterWebhookScale for the workflow_job completion event to arrive,
	// ARC will recreate the completed runner(s), assuming something went wrong in either GitHub, your K8s cluster, or ARC, so ARC needs to resync anyway.
