## About

Actions Runner Controller (ARC) is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates and scales self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions.

With ARC, you can create runner scale sets that automatically scale based on the number of workflows running in your repository, organization, or enterprise. Because controlled runners can be ephemeral and based on containers, new runner instances can scale up or down rapidly and cleanly. For more information about autoscaling, see ["Autoscaling with self-hosted runners."](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners)

You can set up ARC on Kubernetes using Helm, then create and run a workflow that uses runner scale sets. For more information about runner scale sets, see ["Deploying runner scale sets with Actions Runner Controller."](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/deploying-runner-scale-sets-with-actions-runner-controller#runner-scale-set)

## Getting Started

To give ARC a try with just a handful of commands, Please refer to the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/quickstart-for-actions-runner-controller).

For an overview of ARC, please refer to [About ARC](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/about-actions-runner-controller)

With the introduction of [autoscaling runner scale sets](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/discussions/2775), the existing [autoscaling modes](./docs/automatically-scaling-runners.md) are now legacy. The legacy modes have certain use cases and will continue to be maintained by the community only.

For further information on what is supported by GitHub and what's managed by the community, please refer to [this announcement discussion.](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/discussions/2775)
