# Summary of Changes - Fix for Empty job_name in Metrics

## Issue
GitHub Actions Runner Controller (ARC) metrics started showing empty `job_name` labels around June 9, 2025, preventing job-specific analysis and monitoring.

## Solution Implemented
Added fallback logic to handle GitHub API changes where the job name field may be sent as either `jobDisplayName` or `jobName`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Type Changes (`github/actions/types.go`)
- **Added** `JobName` field to `JobMessageBase` struct with JSON tag `"jobName"`
- **Added** `GetJobName()` method that implements fallback logic:
  - Returns `JobDisplayName` if not empty (preferred)
  - Falls back to `JobName` if `JobDisplayName` is empty
  - Ensures compatibility with both old and new GitHub API responses

### 2. Metrics Updates (`cmd/ghalistener/metrics/metrics.go`)
- **Changed** `jobLabels()` function to use `jobBase.GetJobName()` instead of directly accessing `jobBase.JobDisplayName`
- Ensures metrics labels are populated correctly regardless of which field GitHub sends

### 3. Worker Updates (`cmd/ghalistener/worker/worker.go`)
- **Updated** `HandleJobStarted()` to use `GetJobName()` method
- **Enhanced** logging to show both `JobDisplayName`, `JobName`, and `effectiveJobName` for debugging
- Ensures EphemeralRunner status gets the correct job name

### 4. Listener Updates (`cmd/ghalistener/listener/listener.go`)
- **Enhanced** logging in message parsing for all job message types:
  - `JobAvailable` messages
  - `JobStarted` messages
  - `JobCompleted` messages
- Added logging of `JobDisplayName`, `JobName`, and `EffectiveJobName` to help diagnose API behavior

### 5. Tests (`github/actions/types_test.go`)
- **Created** comprehensive unit tests for `GetJobName()` method
- Tests cover all scenarios:
  - Both fields populated (prefers JobDisplayName)
  - Only JobName populated (uses fallback)
  - Only JobDisplayName populated
  - Both fields empty

### 6. Documentation (`docs/FIX_EMPTY_JOB_NAME_METRICS.md`)
- Created detailed documentation explaining the issue, root cause, solution, and deployment notes

## Test Results
✅ All existing tests pass
✅ New unit tests pass
✅ No compilation errors
✅ No lint errors
✅ Backward compatible with existing deployments

## Benefits
1. **Fixes the reported issue**: `job_name` label will be populated in metrics
2. **Backward compatible**: Works with old GitHub API responses
3. **Forward compatible**: Works with new GitHub API responses  
4. **Self-healing**: Automatically adapts to whichever field GitHub sends
5. **Better observability**: Enhanced logging helps diagnose API behavior

## Deployment
No configuration changes required. Simply deploy the updated version and the fix will automatically handle both field names.

Monitor logs after deployment to see which field GitHub is currently using:
- Look for `JobDisplayName`, `JobName`, and `EffectiveJobName` in job start/complete logs
- This will confirm the fix is working and show which API format GitHub is using
