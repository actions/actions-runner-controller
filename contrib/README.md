The `contrib` directory is the place for sharing various example code for deploying and operating `actions-runner-controller`.

Anything contained in this directory is provided as-is. The maintainers of `actions-runner-controller` are not yet committed to provide
full support for using, fixing, and enhancing it. However, they will make their best effort to collect feedback from early adopters and advanced users like you, and may eventually consider graduating any of the examples as an official addition to the project.

See https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/pull/1375#issuecomment-1258816470 and https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/pull/1559#issuecomment-1258827496 for more context.
